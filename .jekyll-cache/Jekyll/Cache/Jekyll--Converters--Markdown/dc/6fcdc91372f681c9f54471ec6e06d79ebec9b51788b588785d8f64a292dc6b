I"Ç<p>Anime, one of the good things to exist in the modern world. A medium with limitless potentials, however itâ€™s pretty shame looking at the direction of a large portion of the anime industry and the anime subculture itself.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Among the anime community are the waifuists, people who are in love with a fictional character, usually from an anime, manga, or a light novel, though waifus/husbandos from other things, like video games, film, or cartoons, are allowed. And these people arenâ€™t doing it satirically and ironically, these people are so unironically obsessed with their waifus/husbandos that they prefer it than actual 
people of the opposite sex of their own. What the frick? May God forgives us all.</p>

<p>This article ainâ€™t meant to spread hate towards waifuists and their ideology. You know, personally I feel so bad for them, not for writing this blog but for what they are doing, to themselves.</p>
